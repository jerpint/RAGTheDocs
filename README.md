# RAGtheDocs

## Introduction üìö

RAGTheDocs is an open-source library that allows you to deploy retrieval augmented generation (RAG) on any readthedocs documentation with a one-click deploy on huggingface spaces!

## Usage

1) Go to the [example space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/jerpint/RAGTheDocs)
2) Duplicate the space:

3) Set your environment variables:
* OPENAI_API_KEY: Needed for the app to work, e.g. `sk-...`
* READTHEDOCS_URL: The url of the website you are interested in scraping
* READTHEDOCS_VERSION: This is important only if there exist multiple versions of the docs (e.g. "en/v0.2.7" or "en/latest"). If left empty, it will scrape all available versions.

**WARNING** This library is experimental and automatically calls OpenAI APIs for you. Use at your own risk! ‚ö†Ô∏è


## Features üöÄ

- **Web Scraping and embeddings:** RAGtheDocs automatically scrapes and embeds documentation from any website generated by ReadTheDocs/Sphinx using OpenAI embeddings

- **RAG Interface:** It comes built-in with a gradio UI for users to interact with [Buster ü§ñ](github.com/jerpint/buster) our RAG agent.
